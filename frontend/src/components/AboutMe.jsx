                <p>I’m Hari Chaitanya Bodakuntla, a Frontend web developer with a focus on creating clean, modern, and
                    interactive web applications. I specialize in Html, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js, and I enjoy
                    turning ideas into seamless user experiences. My journey into coding started with curiosity about
                    how websites work, and over time, it became my passion and career path. Outside of coding, I enjoy
                    exploring design trends and photography, which influence my creative approach to building Web
                    applications. I’m always eager to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and collaborate on
                    meaningful projects
